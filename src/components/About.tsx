        I’m a passionate developer with a focus on building accessible,
        performant web apps that solve real-world problems.

        My interest in the tech industry stems from an interest in new and
        rising technologies, and the ways in which we can use them to
        change/improve business systems. I also enjoy using deductive processes
        to find solutions to problems and creating applications which cater to a
        client’s needs. In 2024, I undertook a software development bootcamp
        with Northcoders, where I learned valuable skills relating to industry
        practices. Using the valuable skillset I was taught here, I pivoted into
        a professional web role as a junior developer.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Since then, I have gained experience working in a lead role as sole
        developer, and have continued to refine my knowledge and continue my
        learning online and in the workplace. As somebody with experience in
        working with a variety of programming languages, as well as a background
        in computer science, my goal is to progress in my career and become a
        senior developer/engineer.

          I love music, and have taught myself to play bass guitar using books
          and online tutorials. I play in a band, which has helped to improve my
          teamwork, creativity and coordination skills. Some of my favourite
          bands include The Cure, The Smiths, Queen, Led Zeppelin, Nirvana and
          Alice in Chains. I also enjoy reading, particularly horror/thriller
          novels and am currently working on writing my first novel.
