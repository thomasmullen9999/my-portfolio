    title: "Meta Front-End Developer",
    issuer: "Coursera",
    date: "2025",
    description: `I decided to spend some time completing Meta's industry-recognised course covering all key concepts used in front-end web development. This was an extremely useful method of consolidating already existing knowledge I held through hands-on dev experience, whilst simultaneously branching into more advanced and specialised topics concerning React.

This course was produced by the same company that created Facebook and Instagram, and is one of the most widely-used frameworks in modern software development worldwide. The course itself was composed of nine smaller courses, ranging from basic introductory concepts to more complex and higher-level ideas, and took several months to complete, with some courses reaching up to 30+ hours in length.`,

    title: "Software Engineering Bootcamp - Certificate of Completion",
    issuer: "Northcoders",
    date: "2024",
    description: `In 2024 I attended Northcoders, a widely recognised coding bootcamp
            in the UK, and undertook their software development course. Here, I
            cemented some of my already-existing skills such as use of HTML/CSS,
            Git and Javascript, and also learned how to apply different
            technologies in both front-end and back-end web design. In regards
            to back-end, I learned how to use SQL (specifically PostgreSQL) to
            seed a database and integrate with an API using Node.js and Express,
            using Test Driven Development to perform unit tests. With front-end,
            I designed the user-facing side of a website with React.js and
            Bootstrap, which I hosted with Netlify. During the final project
            phase of the course, I worked as part of a small team of developers
            to create a mobile application (using React Native, Fireshare,
            Firestore and Expo) called Trek-It Travel. This app allows a user to
            view various travel destinations as well as relevant information
            about local landmarks, restaurants and tourist attractions.`,

    title: "CS50's Introduction to Computer Science",
    issuer: "Harvard University",
    date: "2024",
    description: `            An intensive course with fantastic lectures delivered by Harvard
            University's David Malan. This course not only acted as an
            exceptional resource for learning about important theoretical
            Computer Science concepts, but also provides practical experience in
            a variety of programming languages, starting with the low-level C
            language and eventually moving on to more modern higher level
            languages such as Python, SQL, HTML and CSS. This course covers a
            range of topics, including algorithms, data structures, databases,
            web programming, memory, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity,
            and culminates in a large final project. For my project, I produced
            a web-based fitness application with Flask (using Python/SQL) which
            allows users to store information about gym exercises and a list of
            their favourite foods. They can also track their workouks, keep a
            diary of their dietary intake and record personal daily statistics
            (weight, steps, etc.).`,

    title: "CS50's Introduction to Databases with SQL",
    issuer: "Harvard University",
    date: "2024",
    description: `            This course from Harvard University focusing on SQL was instrumental
            to my understanding of relational databases; here I learned more
            about the CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) methods which are
            used when manipulating data within applications. During the course,
            I learned how to create SQL queries and join them together with
            junction tables and nested SELECT statements. I also learned how to
            optimise query searches with indexes, create views as shortcuts for
            frequently requested data, and write code to add new tables and
            append data to already existing tables. For my final project, I
            created a database called Jukebox.db which allows a user to store
            and alter data about bands, albums, musicians and more. This project
            was created in SQLite3 but I also learned how to use MySQL for
            scaling with larger sets of data.`,

    title: "Computer Science - Diploma of Higher Education (Level 5)",
    issuer: "Manchester Metropolitan University",
    date: "2022",
    description: `            At MMU I began my journey in Computer Science and programming, and
            it was here that I grasped many of the concepts which are
            fundamental to coding such as functional programming vs.
            object-oriented programming, use of conditionals with if/else
            if/else statements, and procedural loops (for, while, do while). I
            developed an understanding of data structures such as linked lists,
            binary trees and stacks/queues, and worked with other colleagues in
            a professional development module to create a group project. I
            learned about Entity Relationship Diagrams and how these can be used
            to represent relational databases. I also learned about assembly
            code and machine language, and how human-readable code is converted
            into machine code which computers can interpret and understand.`,
